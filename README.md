# Project: Create and Setup Your Git and GitHub Account

<h2>Description</h2>

Welcome to my first repository as a full-stack engineer! In this project, I will guide you through the process of creating and setting up your Git and GitHub account. By the end of this project, you will have a solid foundation for version control and collaboration using Git and GitHub.

<h2>Steps</h2>

1.<h5>InstallGit:</h5> If you haven't installed Git on your computer yet, make sure to do so. You can download Git from the official website: git-scm.com.
This is my first project using Git. I'm learning how to use version control and collaborating with others on software development.
